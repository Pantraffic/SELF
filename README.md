Abstract
Partial differential equations (PDE) serve as fundamental tools in describing physical and transportation systems, pos-ing challenges for traditional numerical methods, especially when solving for varying parameters. While deep learning techniques such as Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) offer promising solutions, they face two main limitations: (1) diffi-culty in accurately predicting long-term physical evolution and (2) inefficiency in computation. To address these issues, this paper introduces an innovative deep learning approachâ€”Sequence Learning-based FNO (SELF). Specifically, SELF subdivides the time domain into non-overlapping sub-domains, assigning independent operator networks to each. Additionally, employing a sequential training strategy enables capturing dynamic changes in physical evolution from initial time steps, ensuring the model learns and comprehends unique features of each sub-domain and the complete tem-poral sequence. To further reduce training costs, a transfer learning method is introduced, leveraging optimal parameters and accumulated knowledge from prior training stages. Em-pirical studies demonstrate that compared to the original FNO approach, our method reduces solution errors by 19% for ini-tial and boundary value problems of Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) equations widely used in traffic flow dy-namics, while cutting training costs by 67%.
